          I hired Joseph for a six-month internship, during which he contributed
          to several educational websites focused on programming and data
          visualization.

          Joseph consistently delivered outstanding work. He is a fast learner,
          highly productive, detail-oriented, and deeply curious. What impressed
          me most was his autonomy and proactive approachâ€”he always took the
          initiative without needing guidance.
        </p>

          Whatever role you need to fill, Joseph will exceed your expectations.
