A language model wants to predict what is the most likely word that will occur (not totally accurate, but that doesn't matter here) after a sequence of words. For example, what is the most likely word after the sentence \"The day is off to a bad start, my car crashed this \u2026\"?

Just as a map can show us the location of different cities or landmarks, a statistical model can help us understand how different variables such as age, gender, income, or education may relate to each other. Although statistical models involve mathematics, you don't need to know it to understand the basic concepts behind it. The parameters of language models are determined so that they predict the next most likely word at a given state. To do this, we show them many examples (mostly texts from the Internet) and they keep the patterns present in these texts. Example: most conversations containing \"How are you?\" are followed by \"Fine, and you?\" (or something similar). It is not a universal property that we respond with \"Fine, and you?\", but it is a pattern in the sense that it is something that happens most of the time.

Word embedding is a technique used in natural language processing to represent words as numerical vectors (if you are not at all familiar with vectors, think of them as mathematical objects, like numbers, functions, addition\u2026) in a high-dimensional space. This allows machines to analyze and understand the meaning of words based on their relationships to other words in the same space. Essentially, word embedding helps computers interpret language in a way that approximates the way humans do. The beauty of vectors is that you can do mathematical operations on them, unlike text. For example, a famous example of embedding is that when we remove the vector equivalent of \"man\" from the vector equivalent of \"king\" and add the vector equivalent of \"woman\", we get the vector equivalent of \"queen\", which makes a lot of sense to us!

First, ChatGPT was pre-trained on many different texts from the Internet without any specialization (i.e., it does not specialize in translation, code completion, text classification or anything else). Then it was fine tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback (we will see later what this is about). This means that we ask humans to chat with it, and every time the response is considered harmful, sexist or racist, people send it negative feedback to make it learn the pattern it should avoid, and vice versa. By doing this many times, the model tends not to be harmful.</p>"},{"location":"blog/chatGPT-metric-is-not-truthfulness/#on-a-broader-level","title":"On a broader level","text":"<p>ChatGPT has been trained on a lot of text from the internet, and the internet contains a lot of stuff: from Javascript code to German literature to Minecraft sub reddits. From this, it learns text patterns and draws generalizations from them. When we give it a prompt, it puts a probability distribution on the most likely word that should appear. If we use our last example, the model predicts \"The day is off to a bad start, my car crashed this morning\" since \"morning\" is the most likely word. It will then repeat the same thing, but the prompt will be \"The day is off to a bad start, my car crashed this morning\" and predict the next word, over and over, until the most likely word is the end of the sequence. The most important thing to keep in mind about how chatGPT works is that it doesn't use the Internet or any database, but only tries to predict the most likely word based on what it has seen. And while there may be a correlation between them, what is true and what is most likely are not the same thing. Now that you know the basics of how LLMs like ChatGPT work, let's look at the problems in more detail.</p> <p>Example of how LLM like ChatGPT responds to the prompt: \"Hello sir, any mail for\":</p> <ul> <li>chatGPT calculating a probability distribution of what the next word in this state might be \"Hello sir, any mail for me\"</li> <li>chatGPT calculating a probability distribution of what the next word in this state might be \"Hello sir, any mail for me today?\"</li> <li>chatGPT calculating a probability distribution of what the next word in this state might be \"Hello sir, any mail for me today?

The agent's goal is to maximize its long-term reward by learning which actions to take in which situations.</p> <p>One approach to using human feedback in RL is to have humans provide feedback during the learning process. In this case, humans can guide the agent on what actions to take in certain situations, or provide feedback on the agent's decisions in real time. This type of feedback can be particularly useful in situations where the agent is learning a complex task and may need additional guidance to achieve good performance.</p> <p>In the case of LLMs, OpenAI (the creators of ChatGPT) used reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) by employing dozens of people (called AI trainers) and asking them to rank model outputs for a given text input.</p> <p>Who did it? What were the criteria? Since the goal of RLHF is to make LLMs less harmful, we need to define them. If we want to be rigorous, we should make explicit the method used since this is an important feature of ChatGPT. But OpenAI chooses not to give any information about this: what was considered harmful? Were instructions given to the AI trainers before or during the training phase? The heart of the problem is that this method will never be 100% safe since it is approximate: the model will tend to be non-harmful (according to a subjective, undefined definition). With enough roleplay (example here), you can make ChatGPT say harmful things easily. Rather than working on the real security issues like developing a better understanding of LLM decisions (interpretability issues), OpenAI unfortunately chose the easy way out.

Rather, it is an agent that tries to suggest as many answers as possible to our prompts. However, unlike a human agent, its reasoning is very specific: it predicts what the most likely word will be until the end of the sequence. And what is most plausible in a discussion and the truth are not the same thing. The metric of ChatGPT is not truthfulness. In fact, we are not able to create a similar ChatGPT whose goal will be to say what is true since it is extremely complex to formally ask an LLM to be as true as possible. One could argue that we can simply train the LLM only on texts that are true. But how do we objectively distinguish a text that is true from one that is not? What is true (not so easy to answer\u2026)? And even if we were able to solve these questions, there is no reason to think that this guarantees that the model will only say true things.</p> <p>What if ChatGPT's metric was truthfulness? Goodhart's Law (named after the economist Charles Goodhart) is a concept that states that \"When a measure becomes a goal, it ceases to be a good measure\". In other words, when a specific measure or indicator is used to assess or induce a particular behavior, people may change their behavior to achieve that measure, even though it may not reflect the true desired outcome. This can lead to unintended consequences and distortions in the system being measured. This means that even if we create a model that optimizes for veracity, there will still be no reason for the model to say the wrong things. One name for this problem is the specification gaming: we are not able to specify clearly what we want. You can find examples of this problem in this article from Deepmind.</p> <p>More generally, the measurement problem is not specific to the field of AI but to statistics as a whole.

The point behind using packages is that it makes you gain lots of time since you can use super useful functions without even knowing how they work.

Intuitively, we want to interview different successful people and ask them questions about their lifestyle, the reasons for their success and try to find commonalities. But this method poses a major problem: we have to look for differences, not similarities. The famous reasons that I have the impression people associate with success are: working hard, being fit/exercising regularly, being highly motivated, reading, meditating, etc. And it's plausible that, in the course of interviews, these elements come up in discussion. However, if most successful people play sports regularly, does that mean there's a correlation with being successful and those? Not at all.</p> <p>That's where the differences are important.

Whether in statistics or in \"real life\", it has the same meaning. One can think of cognitive biases, statistical biases or more generally scientific biases. An estimator can be considered as unbiased if the difference between the expected value of the parameter studied (i.e. what we are supposed to obtain if we can interview an infinite number of students) and the \"real\" (or \"true\") parameter is zero. But one could say that if we already knew the \"true\" value of the parameter, why bother making an estimate? In fact, we don't know it and that's the problem: it is not so easy to know if our estimator is biased or not.</p> <p>Fortunately, we have mathematical statistics that can determine whether an estimator is biased or not, but they are not sufficient because they regularly assume assumptions that are not always verified (we won't talk about this in more detail here because it is mostly about mathematics and the way we collect our data).</p> <p>If we return to our example with the average number of hours students work before an exam, it's easy to find biases. For example, asking only students during class implies that students who do not attend class will not answer our question. And it seems plausible that students who don't go to class work less (or more? who knows) for exams. And if we take a completely opposite example like \"How many beers did I drink last year per week on average?\", I have to think about things like \"Does my current consumption influence what I think I drank last year?\". At this point, you might start to wonder why being so methodical about such unimportant questions.

It tells us how far people in our sample tend to deviate from the mean. In contrast, a variance of zero is equivalent to everyone having the same value (i.e. in our example, all students work the same amount of time before an exam). The connection to estimation is the fact that we want to know if our estimator has a high or low variance.</p> <p>This is important because a low variance implies that, especially if our estimator is unbiased, we can be sure that we can make generalizations from our sample to the rest of the world. For example, if we estimate that a student works an average of 4 hours before an exam and we know that this estimate is unbiased and has a low variance, it is very likely that the \"true\" value is around 4.</p> <p>It is important to keep in mind that we make estimates all the time. When you wonder if you're going to find a place to park your car, which college is best for you, or if you've eaten too much, you're making an estimate. You're trying to figure something out, but because you don't have all the information in the world, you're making an approximation based on what you know.</p> <p>To that end, I think the best way to make a better estimate is to think about the possible biases and the level of variance in your estimate.

As we said before, you don't have all the information in the world. If this were not the case, estimation would be meaningless. You only have access to a (very small) sample of information, and we can define some criteria that tell us whether, based on our data, we can make generalizations to the rest of the world from that sample. In statistics, a very common way to do this is to calculate the p-value.</p> <p>For example, if we want to know if a drug is effective in reducing LDL blood cholesterol, we give it to people with high LDL and after a week compare the difference with people who also have high LDL but did not take the drug (preferably a placebo). From there, assuming the drug is not effective, we can calculate what the probability is of getting the results we did (e.g., people who took the drug reduced their LDL by 10 points and those who took the placebo by only 4 points). If this probability is very low, we can deduce that our initial hypothesis might not be true (i.e. that the drug is effective for reducing LDL blood cholesterol!).</p> <p>The convention is 5%. If a difference of 6 (10 - 4 = 6) had a probability of less than 5% of occurring, we say that our result is significant and that we cannot accept the hypothesis that the drug is ineffective.</p> <p>This concept of p-value implies other important concepts. If we take the convention of 5%, this amounts to taking a 5% risk threshold to conclude that there is an effect even if this is not the case in practice. In a slightly more formal way, we can describe:</p> <ul> <li>False positive: conclude that there is an effect even if there is not.</li> <li>False negative: conclude that there is no effect even if there is one.</li> </ul> <p>You can familiarize yourself with these concepts by thinking about a COVID-19 test. There is a probability that it will say you have it even if you don't, as well as a probability that it will say you don't have it even if you do (a bit more problematic). In practice, there is a trade-off between maximizing and minimizing the probability of false positives or negatives. In the clinical field, one would naturally prefer to minimize the probability of telling a person that there is nothing wrong with them when they are sick.

But last year, for some reason, every other Sunday was very sunny. Adding this information to my last belief (and if I am a rational Bayesian person), I would have to change my belief. My new belief about Sunday weather in Bordeaux is more nuanced than my old belief.

However, there are still many useful concepts for what we are talking about here.</p> <p>Let's say I want to create a model that can predict if a person has a tumor using an MRI scan. To do this, I've created a dumb model that can't do anything right. When I show it a scan and ask it if there is a tumor, its answers are purely random. Then I show it a lot of MRI scans with and without tumors and tell him for each one if there is one or not. By doing this (and using optimization algorithms), it starts to learn the difference between good and bad MRI scans. Now my model is much better than it was at the beginning and I ask if there is a tumor on the new scans that it hasn't already seen. If I did all the last things right, my model can now predict if a person has a tumor using MRIs. It has \"learned\" from the example and is now able to generalize to new scans.</p> <p>If you understood that last point, you now have in mind the main idea of how machine learning works. Of course, it is much more complex in practice, but we use exactly the same logic when we train a model to perform a task.</p>"},{"location":"blog/statistics-in-our-daily-life/#overunder-fitting","title":"Over/under-fitting","text":"<p>Overfitting and under-fitting are two very important concepts in machine learning. Over-fitting occurs when we train our model, it learns so much from the example you gave it that it cannot generalize to new examples. This can happen when we over-train a model, for example. An analogy would be a student who memorizes all their lectures, but doesn't know how to respond when the professor asks a question that is based on understanding the lecture, not memorizing it (sound familiar? Yeah, me too).</p> <p>Another way to think about this concept is to consider that our experience is representative of what happens to others in life. Over the course of our lives, we have many experiences, learn from them, and then try to avoid the mistakes and repeat the positive things. This is fine until the overfitting occurs: we should not be overconfident in generalizing to new events since our experience is not necessarily representative. Also, you can see here that more experience could lead to more overfitting. One way to overcome this is to \"train\" yourself with a \"variety of data\": get into the habit of asking other people what they think about things you have experienced and compare the differences.</p> <p>On the other hand, under-fitting is when a student has not studied enough for an exam and simply cannot answer the questions. For example, it's like having no experience in public speaking and trying to give advice to others. You don't need to know everything, and being \"sub-competent\" in a given area is not a problem at all. It's actually an excellent quality to know when we don't know (probably more often than we'd like).</p>"},{"location":"blog/statistics-in-our-daily-life/#closing-remarks","title":"Closing remarks","text":"<p>This might be a good time to explain why being so methodical, even for unimportant matters, is so important. The main reason is that it creates excellent habits of epistemology. You will be more open-minded, better at describing problems formally, more critical of yourself, and learn from others. I really believe that most of our beliefs come from the way we approach information based on our epistemological habits, i.e. on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>Another benefit of using all of these concepts on a daily basis is the fact that it makes the discussion much more precise, fun, interesting and with a great vocabulary. You can't imagine how nice it is to have a discussion with someone who always uses the right term and how easy it is to understand the point.</p> <p>This article was just an introduction to many different concepts that would all deserve a full book. I made a lot of approximations because my main goal is not to be accurate but to give you the intuition of how statistical methods work. If you don't come from a stats background, I hope you have a better understanding of stats and have found some useful concepts here for you. If you do statistics regularly, I hope you'll start thinking about using these concepts outside of work. If you are somewhere in between, I hope you learned something.</p>"},{"location":"blog/statistics-in-our-daily-life/#feedback","title":"Feedback","text":"<p>Having a different opinion?
