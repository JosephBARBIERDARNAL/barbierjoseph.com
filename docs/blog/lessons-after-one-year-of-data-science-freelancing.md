## Intro

About a year ago, I did my last internship and officially finished my master in applied maths. I had a bit of money on the side and [Yan Holtz](https://www.yan-holtz.com/){target="\_blank"} asked me if I wanted to create an online course on matplotlib with him. My 2 options were:

- apply for jobs (I did a few interviews)
- start freelancing, create the course with Yan and look for clients

Since I feel like I had nothing to lose, I decided to go freelance and look for a regular job if I don't have money anymore. I'll start by describing the upsides (money, workload, etc) of this decision, and then the downsides.

I knew I'd be able to make a minimum amount of money which would have let me around a few months combined with my savings. My idea was to work on side projects / open source if I didn't have any client to work for.

It turns out to be **the best experience** I could have imagined.

Yan and I created [this course](https://www.matplotlib-journey.com/){target="\_blank"} (where I learned **a lot** about building and selling a product). We're still working on it, but most of the work is now done, students are happy and I now have a "passive" income (not 100%, but I don't believe such things really exist).

At the same time, I met [David Keyes](https://dgkeyes.com/){target="\_blank"} via a post on LinkedIn saying he was looking for someone to write blog posts about dataviz. I've been working for him since then (almost a year now!), on many projects, as a consultant. I learn(ed) a lot, met other freelancers working for him and plan to continue to grow with him and his new company [Clarity Data Studio](https://claritydatastudio.com/){target="\_blank"}.

And then other people I met along the way or just contacted me offered me to work with them, which I am very grateful for.

## Upsides

#### Money

Since that's the thing most people (including myself) are the most interested in, I want to share exact figures.

To be honest, I earned significantly more money than I was expecting.

At the same time, you can see that there is **no pattern**. Even I realized I'm pretty bad at estimating how much I'll earn next month. Also, the first 2 months were not enough for me to cover my spending. If I didn't have savings, I couldn't have started this project.

#### Remote

At the moment, I've only worked 100% remotely and asynchronously. That means I work whenever I want and wherever I want, which is an amazing thing.

One of the great things here is that it works because I work with people that trust me. My clients don't care about what I do during my day while I'm doing the job. I believe it makes me enjoy and care more about the work I'm doing because I feel responsible.

I also have very few calls (~between 1 and 3 per week). They last around 20-30 minutes on average.

#### Workload

It's very hard for me to estimate how much I work on average. And since I spend a significant amount of time doing open source work (e.g., not for clients), I need to take that into account.

I do believe that if I only take freelance work into account, I could easily fit everything into a **9 to 4 (6 hours per day), Monday to Friday**, with many weeks off over the year. If I include open source work, I think it would be more a **9 to 6, Monday to Sunday**.

That means it's perfectly possible (in my case) to have a chill work life.

Finally, it's just great to be able to randomly just not work on a Tuesday afternoon because your unemployed friend wants to go to a café.

#### Actual work

Last but not least, **I love what I do**. I literally learn things every day, I work with people who have a lot more experience than me and I can really benefit from that.

I've started using tools I would have never expected to even hear about, and it makes me feel like I can just learn anything I want, assuming I take the time. My job is really about learning how to use stuff and combine them with other stuff I already know.

I'm also super happy to be able to work on open source work, mostly on my own tools. But I'm planning to according more time to existing projects.

## Downsides

To be honest, I don't feel like there are major downsides. The reasons for that are, I believe, very subjective. Many people might not feel the same about working remotely, not having financial visibility, etc. I still made a list because it's worth mentioning, but in my case, I'm overall very satisfied.

- If I don't have clients anymore, I don't have unemployment benefit contrary to most people where I live.
- It can be stressful to be responsible for making your clients happy. I don't stress much about it anymore.
- Sometimes I can have a very high amount of work and it's hard to predict when.
- Working fully remotely makes you solo most of the time (but that's easily solvable by working from cafés or coworking places).

## Takeaways

- Luck is very useful. I'm 100% sure I had more luck than the average person. If I started over, I wouldn't expect the same results.
- Confidence matters **a lot**. Being able to price your work confidently, tell your client(s) that you know how to fix a given issue, and so on, gives the feeling that people can trust you.
- A very common thing, but **people don't care** that much about technical stuff (even other developers!) but rather about the outcome.
- Work conditions are super important. I prefer earning much less but not having to go to work every morning at 9 a.m. with people I don't particularly like.
- A single person can have a massive impact on your life, and you **can't** predict it. Yan and David (among others) mentioned before are just two examples that changed the picture significantly in my case, and my encounters with them were quite random.
- Life is great.
