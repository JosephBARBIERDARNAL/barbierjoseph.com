## Open source is hard

- large codebase
- large documentation
- large user base
- importance of backward compatibility
- code practices
- often not paid

## (good) Issues are contributions too

- unless you only care about being in the contributor list, code is just one way of contributing
- report bugs in an easy to understand way is very useful
- more generally, express yourself well
- being kind is free, even if others are not

## Writing reprexes is a very useful skill

- what is a reprex
- why is it so important for maintainers
- why they can't do much about your "bug" if they can't reproduce it
- reprexes is also a way to show that you value others people time
- knowing how to write reprexes is a great skill, more generally knowing how to isolate a specific behavior, but it's harder than it looks

## Put yourself in the maintainers' shoes

- likely that the person in front of you is not paid, or not that much
- they are not consultants
- when opening an issue, consider yourself a maintainer of the project too!
