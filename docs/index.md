# Hi! I'm Joseph

I'm passionate about **open-source** development and **data analysis**. I live in France, working as a **freelance** data scientist and dedicating time to open-source projects.

I'm also eager to chat with tech people, so if you're using one of my packages, have a question, want to share a project you have or want to know more about my services, don't hesitate to contact me: <code>joseph.barbierdarnal@gmail.com</code>
