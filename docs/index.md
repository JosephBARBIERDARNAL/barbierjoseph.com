<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hi! I'm Joseph</h1>

I recently founded [yellow sunflower](https://ysunflower.com/), an organization dedicated to creating **open-source tools** for data scientists and offering **data consulting services**.

=== "Consulting"

    Most of my consulting work focuses on making **data workflows** simpler, more reproducible, and visually clean, from analysis to reports.

    My core tools are **Python/R** for data work, **Typst** to create high-quality PDFs, and **HTML/CSS/JS** for web reports. I primarily work with clients in France (where I live!) and the United States. _Feel free to send a message if you're interested!_

=== "Open source"

    Most of my open-source work focuses on **data visualization**. I've developed and maintain [multiple Python packages](https://github.com/y-sunflower) and made tons of contributions to the [Python Graph Gallery](https://github.com/holtzy/The-Python-Graph-Gallery) and the [R Graph Gallery](https://github.com/holtzy/R-graph-gallery).

    Sometimes I try to contribute to other projects too!

=== "Other"

    I do some other things, such as [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ysunflower-data), [TidyTuesday challenges](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/tidytuesday), and [talks](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/talk).

=== "Before"

    Before working for my own company, I did internships at [CIERI](https://cieri.fr/) (research center), [Wanteeed](https://wanteeed.com/en/) (e-commerce platform), and [Dataviz Universe](https://www.yan-holtz.com/) (Yan Holtz's company).

    I also hold a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in applied mathematics and statistics, both from the University of Bordeaux.
