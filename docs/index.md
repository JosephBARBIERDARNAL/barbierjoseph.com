<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hi! I'm Joseph</h1>

I recently founded [yellow sunflower](https://ysunflower.com/), an organization dedicated to creating **open source tools** for data scientists and offering **data consulting services**.

Most of my consulting work focuses on making **data workflows** simpler, more reproducible, and visually clean, from analysis to reports. I primarily work with clients in France (where I live!) and the United States. _Feel free to send a message if you're interested!_

<p style="padding-bottom:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">I try not to focus too much on the tools, but rather on the results. However, I mainly work with:</p>

- Python/R for all data work
- Typst to create high-quality PDFs
- HTML/CSS/JS (and sometimes TS/React)

??? Before

    Before working for my own company, I did internships at [CIERI](https://cieri.fr/) (research center), [Wanteeed](https://wanteeed.com/en/) (e-commerce platform), and [Dataviz Universe](https://www.yan-holtz.com/) (Yan Holtz's company).

    I also hold a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in applied mathematics and statistics, both from the University of Bordeaux.
