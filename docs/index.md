<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hi! I'm Joseph</h1>

I'm a freelance **data scientist**. Recently, I created [yellow sunflower](https://ysunflower.com/), an organization focused on building **open-source tools** for data visualization, design, and storytelling.

Most of my freelance work focuses on making **data workflows** simpler, more reproducible, and visually clean, from analysis to reports. I primarily work with clients in France and the United States.
