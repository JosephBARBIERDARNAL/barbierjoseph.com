# Hi! I'm Joseph

I'm passionate about **open-source** development and **data analysis**. I live in France, working as a **freelance** data scientist and dedicating time to open-source projects.

### Work

I'm currently working on **developing my company**. It will provide open source tools and consultancy services as a continuation of what I'm doing as a freelancer.

#### Consulting

Most of my consultancy work focuses on **data science projects**, using Python or R. I also work with tools such as Quarto and React. My core expertise lies in data visualization though I handle a wide variety of projects for my clients.

#### Open source

I contribute to and maintain various packages, primarily in the **Python dataviz world**. My goal is to simplify data science tasks without compromising on extensive customization capabilities.

These projects are installed more than **50k times a month**.
